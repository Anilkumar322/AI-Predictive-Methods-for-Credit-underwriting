# AI Predictive Methods for Credit Underwriting

This project is a **Streamlit-based AI Predictive Methods for Credit Underwriting application** that utilizes a machine learning model to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on user-provided inputs. The app generates a downloadable PDF report with detailed results and insights.
